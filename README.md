# Gamendar

This is a simple (work in progress) Android app that makes it easy to add events for video game release dates to your google calendar.

This app is sort of a fork of my other app [Gametime](https://github.com/mitchhymel/gametime-flutter), but meant to be much more lightweight with all the journal and cataloguing functionality stripped out. 

# Technologies used

[Flutter](https://flutter.io/) as the cross platform framework the app UI is built on.


# Dependencies

I use [IGDB.com](https://www.igdb.com) for the game data. This project depends on the IGDB client I wrote available here: [dart-igdb_client](https://github.com/mitchhymel/dart-igdb_client)
